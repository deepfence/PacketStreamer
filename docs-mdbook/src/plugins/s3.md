# S3

The S3 plugins allows to stream packets to the given S3 buckets.

## Configuration

### AWS credentials

Before running PacketStreamer, AWS credentials need to be configured by one of
the following ways:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables
- `~/.aws/config` file - it can be created by `aws configure`

The first way might be more convenient when running as root (required when
running a sensor).

### Configuration scheme

S3 plugin configuration has the following syntax:

```yaml
output:
  plugins:                         # optional
    s3:
      bucket: _string_
      region: _string_
      totalFileSize: _file_size_   # optional; default: 10 MB
      uploadChunkSize: _file_size_ # optional; default: 5 MB
      uploadTimeout: _timeout_     # optional; default: 1m
      cannedACL: _acl_             # optional; default: Bucket owner enforced
```

### Sensor configuration

If you want to stream locally captured packets from sensor to S3, you can use
the following example configuration from
[contrib/config/sensor-s3.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepfence/PacketStreamer/main/contrib/config/sensor-s3.yaml):

```yaml
{{#rustdoc_include ../../../contrib/config/sensor-s3.yaml}}
```

And run PacketStreamer with it:

```bash
sudo packetstreamer sensor --config ./contrib/config/sensor-s3.yaml
```

### Receiver configuration

If you want to stream packets from receiver to S3, you can use the following
example configuration from
[contrib/config/receiver-s3.yaml]

```yaml
{{#rustdoc_include ../../../contrib/config/receiver-s3.yaml}}
```

```bash
packetstreamer receiver --config ./contrib/config/receiver-s3.yaml
```
